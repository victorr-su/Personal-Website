# Personal Website

Check out my website on my custom domain!: http://victor-su.rf.gd/


## What is this?
- This is a personal website/portfolio about me, showcasing who I am and the skills I have. It also allows you to get to know a bit about me! 
- It contains 6 sections, showing my projects, resume, and other info. There is also a comment section, so feel free to give me feedback or let me know you what think.

## Why did I create this project?
- I wanted to showcase the web development skills I learned during my free time outside of academics.
- Creating this project allowed me to learn a lot about web development and the process it takes to build something from scratch. It helped developed my problem solving skills and expose me to the world of front-end and a littl bit of back-end development

## What technologies did I use to create this?
- For the front-end, the project is made up of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Fontawesome (for icons).
- For the back-end, I used PHP and MySQL to store GET/PUSH data for the comment section
